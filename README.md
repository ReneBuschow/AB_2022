Dear reader, within our here installed github project directory. We publish the code generated to solve our specific questions. You can download and modify the published code as desired given the citation of the person who generated it:
Ren√© Buschow, Imaging Core Facility, Max Planck Institut for Molecular Genetics, 14195 Berlin - Germany, buschow@molgen.mpg.de, 0049 30 8413 1663. 
Please also cite the Perosn who inspired, alpha-beta-gamma- tested and utilized it corresponding author Dr. Adriano Bolondi.

The available code and snippets are organized projectwise some will not be found in actual versions of our manuscript but are used for additional, beautiful experiments (:, you can download them for any purpose as well. 

DEMO-Data: Data for pixelwise correlation analysis as well as line-profile analysis can be found here: https://nc.molgen.mpg.de/cloud/index.php/s/sGNPesxDjgtM28E
Run-Time: If the user testing person is familiar with r and fiji/imagej and have it ready installed than all codes should run in less than 5 minutes on average desktop-pcs.


We are ready and happy to share way more raw data, please be aware/prepared that many of our experiments are imaging based and therefore often exceeed 10,20... gb . 
We have the the infrastructure to share it over own online repository but our data policy is sencouraging us to better archive data than cloud share it on a long term.

#### FIJI/imagej
Version: The code was generated in FIJI v1.53 and v1.54f, the creator of the code used base functionalities therefore it should work it almost all version. 
System Requirements: The scripts were generated under Windows 10 but should work under Linux & MAC as well (not tested).
Installation: Copy or open Code in any ImageJ/FIJI

### R ### 
Version: The code was generated in R v3.5.1 and 4.0.2. However, the creator of the code is a huge fan of base r functionalities with as few special packages as possible. 
System Requirements: The scripts were generated under Windows 10 but should work under Linux & MAC as well (not tested). 
Consequently the here published code/snippets will work in almost each R/Rstudio enviroment.
Installation: Copy the, or open Code in R

### ZEN ### 
Version: The here uploaded ZEN Image analysis setting was generated under ZEN blue version 3.2 (licensed by Zeiss Germany), exclusively windows.
System Requirements: For testing pupose you can download (Zeiss.com) a two month trial license for ZEN and its 
related image analysis module
Installation:  Simply import the .czias file into the image analysis module.
